# Simplr
Simplr (aka simplr styler) is a way to increase productivity by simplifying web styling but still leaving huge extensions for the user to develop.

Simplr's aim is to simplify styling front end designs by handling the stuff every not-really-a-frontend-designer tries to accomplish like grid system, positioning, text, panel handling etc...

## Getting Started
Simplr is meant to be, simple. It offers various controls over HTML elements, such as:
* Complete Gridr (Grid) System
* Complete Color Sets
* Responsiveness
* Success/Warn/Danger/Info Panels

At the time being, Simplr has a working prototype but it is not recommended to use until beta state is achieved.

### About Gridr System
Unlike the most of grid systems out there, Gridr uses a 20 (2x, 4x, 5x) grid system instead of 12 (2x, 3x, 4x, 6x). This brings an even better positioning to the front ends.
